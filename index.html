                    <h3>Atlanta, the city in the forest</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to Atlanta where the players play!
                       Due to its geographical location in the Appalachian Foothills, Atlanta has a lush and diverse landscape and the densest urban tree coverage of any major city in the US.
                       Visitors can enjoy the scenery by picnicking at Piedmont Park, canoeing down the Chattahoochee River, or climbing atop Stone Mountain or Kennesaw Mountain. 
                       Atlanta is home to a large and diverse population, exhibited by its extensive food scene and Michelin-nominated restaurants. There are also many nationally and internationally recognized places of interest, such as Centennial Olympic Park, the Coca-cola Museum, Zoo Atlanta, the Georgia Aquarium, and many more.

                       Formerly known as Terminus and Marthasville, Atlanta has always had close ties to the railroad industry due to its location as a hub of the southeastern US.
                       During the American Civil War, Atlanta was a strategic and central military base for the Confederacy. General Sherman razed much of the city during his historic march in 1864, but the city recovered over time, giving it the nickname "The Phoenix City".
                       Today, Atlanta is also known as "The City Too Busy to Hate" for its diverse population, business expansion, and Hartsfield-Jackson Airport.
